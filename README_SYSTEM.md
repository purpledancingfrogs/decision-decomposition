# Decision Decomposition — System Overview

## Purpose
This repository implements an intelligence-grade system for structuring decisions under extreme uncertainty. It combines formal decomposition, measurable clarity metrics, and cross-model convergence evidence to produce auditable, reproducible analytic outcomes.

## Architecture Map
- src/decision_decomposition/ — core decomposition engine
- tests/ — verification and correctness
- examples/ — applied scenarios
- benchmarks/ — performance framing
- logs/runs/ — execution traceability
- cross-model-convergence-benchmark/
  - protocol/ — methodology
  - analysis/ — interpretation
  - raw_outputs/{gpt4,claude,grok} — verbatim evidence

## Invariants (First-Class)
- Variable completeness
- Constraint preservation
- Failure-mode exhaustiveness
- Auditability
- Reproducibility

## Canonical Flow
Ambiguity → Decomposition → Metrics → Cross-model execution → Convergence assessment → Audit trail

## Boundaries
- No persuasion
- No post-processing
- No semantic smoothing
- No human correction
- No claims beyond observed structure

## Status
Operational. Evidence-backed. Method-owned.
