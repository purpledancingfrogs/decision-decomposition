## Identified Invariants
- Priority ordering of loads is fixed
- Safety constraints dominate speed
- Information latency increases risk

## Recommended Actions
1. Isolate failed segments
2. Restore hospital circuits first
3. Stagger grid reactivation
4. Maintain redundant communication channels

## Notes
Invariant structure remained stable across alternative response strategies.
