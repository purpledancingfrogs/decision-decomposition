# Invariants

1. Variable Completeness
Unmodeled variables dominate outcomes.

2. Constraint Dominance
Hidden constraints override optimized controls.

3. Irreversibility
Irreversible actions amplify downside risk.

4. Time-to-Clarity Nonlinearity
Decision quality collapses once clarity lags time pressure.

5. Narrative Substitution
Narrative coherence cannot replace structural completeness.
