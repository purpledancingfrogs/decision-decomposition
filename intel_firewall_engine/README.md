# Intel Firewall Engine

A deterministic simulation engine for observing how intelligence degrades, redistributes, and contradicts itself when forced through constrained interfaces.

This engine does **not** resolve contradiction.
It measures it.

---

## Concept

Intelligence is treated as a conserved quantity distributed across channels.

A firewall is any constraint that:
- limits bandwidth
- forces prioritization
- introduces asymmetric loss
- creates incompatible perspectives

The engine observes what survives.

---

## Intelligence Channels

Default channels:
- SIGINT
- HUMINT
- OSINT

Channels are normalized to a total mass of 1.0 before firewalling.

---

## Firewall Behavior

Firewalls:
- attenuate channels differently
- introduce non-linear redistribution
- amplify latent contradictions
- never collapse state to a single outcome

No optimization is performed.

---

## Outputs

- Post-firewall channel distribution
- Contradiction index ∈ [0,1]
- Deterministic and repeatable

If contradiction goes to zero, the model has failed.
