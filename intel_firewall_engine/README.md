# Intel Firewall Engine

A contradiction-preserving intelligence engine.

This module models intelligence analysis as the movement of information across **firewalls**—boundaries where observation, secrecy, deception, or uncertainty reshape signals without forcing premature resolution.

Unlike traditional analytic systems that optimize toward consensus or collapse ambiguity, the Intel Firewall Engine **preserves paradox by design**.

## Core Idea

In real intelligence environments, information is often:
- entangled across sources,
- altered by observation,
- degraded by time,
- distorted by adversarial pressure.

Treating these effects as bugs produces false certainty.  
Treating them as **structural dynamics** produces stability.

This engine formalizes that distinction.

## What This Engine Does

- Represents signals as structured probability distributions
- Applies observation boundaries (“firewalls”) that reshape signals without resolving contradictions
- Quantifies information loss, suppression, and persistence
- Maintains audit trails across observation events

## Design Principles

- **No forced resolution** — contradictions are retained, not eliminated
- **Deterministic structure** — every transformation is explicit and reproducible
- **Invariant-aware** — integrates with decision-decomposition invariants
- **Operational** — runnable, inspectable, benchmarkable

## Relationship to the Repository

This engine complements:
- `decision-decomposition/` — structural clarity and variable geometry
- `decision-structure-invariants/` — consistency constraints under uncertainty
- `cross-model-convergence-benchmark/` — model agreement without truth collapse

The firewall engine models **what happens when clarity is not possible**.

## Status

Minimal operational kernel.
Executable.
Extensible.

Future modules will add:
- multi-firewall chains
- evaporation dynamics
- contradiction persistence metrics
- invariant-linked simulations

This is infrastructure, not narrative.
