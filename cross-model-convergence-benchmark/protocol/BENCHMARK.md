# Cross-Model Decision Invariant Benchmark

## Objective
Measure convergence on decision-structure invariants across independent models.

## Inputs
- Identical decision case files
- No system prompts
- No memory
- No coordination

## Models
- GPT-4
- Claude
- Grok

## Output Requirement
Each model must return:
1. Identified invariants
2. Failure modes
3. Priority ordering
4. Justification (brief)

## Scoring
Convergence is structural, not linguistic.
Semantic similarity is ignored.
