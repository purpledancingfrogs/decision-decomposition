situation: "Regional power outage during a heat wave"

objectives:
  - maintain power to hospitals and emergency services
  - prevent cascading grid failure
  - restore service to the general population

knowns:
  - ambient_temperature_celsius: ">35"
  - electricity_demand: "elevated"
  - hospitals_on_backup_power: true
  - grid_operating_near_capacity: true

unknowns:
  - primary_failure_location
  - remaining transformer margin
  - time_to_secondary_failures

constraints:
  - hospital power loss unacceptable
  - grid frequency must remain within tolerance
  - repair crews limited in number

assumptions:
  - fuel supply for generators is finite
  - public communication affects demand behavior
