# Decision Structure Invariants

## Invariant 1 — Unconstrained Control Illusion
If a decision-maker treats uncontrollable variables as controllable, failure is inevitable.

## Invariant 2 — Hidden Constraint Dominance
Unmodeled constraints dominate outcomes more strongly than modeled variables.

## Invariant 3 — Time-to-Closure Compression
As time pressure increases, decision quality collapses nonlinearly once structural clarity is incomplete.

## Invariant 4 — Irreversibility Blindness
Decisions that ignore irreversible actions systematically underestimate downside risk.

## Invariant 5 — Narrative Substitution Failure
When narrative coherence substitutes for structural completeness, prediction accuracy degrades even if confidence rises.
